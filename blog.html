        <h3>Redefinning the Office: How We Work in 2025</h3>

                <p>The way we think about workplaces is evolving at breakneck speed. For those who own or manage large office complexes, the question isn’t whether technology will play a role in redefining workplaces—it’s how you can leverage it to make your property more appealing, safer and efficient. In 2025, tenants and employees expect spaces that go beyond offering a roof over their heads. They’re looking for workplaces that help them stay productive, connected and secure. Here’s a detailed breakdown of eleven ways technology is reshaping the future of workplace in 2025 and why it matters for premise owners.<br>Imagine if an employee or visitor enters a large office building and does not know how to reach the meeting room or a particular desk. It’s a maddening situation that others have faced. This is where indoor location technology comes in. Employees and visitors alike make their way to desks, meeting rooms or even the closest restroom, with step-by-step instructions sent directly to their devices.For premise owners, having such indoor wayfinding systems in your property adds to its attractiveness. It’s not just convenience—it’s time-saving and creating a better-building experience. They are also more likely to renew leases when they see their employees working comfortably and unencumbered.<br>Safety is non-negotiable and technology like geofencing can make a big difference in how office spaces are managed and why it is considered as a future of workplace in 2025. Geofencing creates virtual boundaries within your property. For example, you can restrict access to certain areas—like maintenance zones or storage rooms—where employees shouldn’t be wandering. If someone crosses into a restricted area, an alert can be sent immediately to security or building management.For owners of large-footprint office complexes, that’s the game-changing feature. It demonstrates to tenants that you take safety seriously and can eliminate accidents or unauthorized access. Whether you have employees of your own or rent space to companies, geofencing makes sure that everyone who walks into the building is safe.<br>Heat mapping tracks foot traffic in real-time, using sensors to identify which areas of your complex are overcrowded — and which are being ignored. This workplace technology trend proves to be invaluable in managing safety, especially considering a world in the post-pandemic scenario where physical distancing might still be applicable in certain situations.As a premise owner, heat mapping empowers you to make educated decisions around layouts. Are there certain times when your lobby areas are always overcrowded? You can reposition furniture to facilitate people’s flow. The opposite applies too: if an entire wing of the building is hardly being used, you might want to repurpose it or offer it to tenants with different needs. It’s a win-win — you’re creating a safer, more efficient space for the tenants while maximizing your rental revenue.<br>Hybrid work isn’t going anywhere. Tenants are increasingly moving toward flexible schedules where employees split their time between the office and home. A desk booking system is the backbone of this model, allowing employees to reserve desks a day—or even weeks—in advance. This ensures that when they arrive at the office, everything is ready for them. This technology is considered as one of the top remote work trends for 2025 who occasionally and alternatively visit the office. For owners, offering a desk booking solution makes your property more attractive to companies embracing this trend. It shows that your space can adapt to new work models, making it easier for tenants to manage their teams. This kind of flexibility is exactly what businesses are looking for in 2025.<br>Emergencies like medical issues, personal safety concerns or workplace violence require quick action. SOS functions in wearables, such as those Mapsted provides, give employees the technology in workplace that strengthens the ability to ask for assistance in the click of a button. They send out their exact location — and help arrives quickly.SOS technology is a new must-have feature, setting your property apart while showcasing a strong commitment to safety for tenants and staff alike. Research shows wearable technology boosts workplace productivity by 8.5% and employee satisfaction by 3.5%. Offering this feature not only enhances security but also adds significant value to your building for safety-conscious tenants.<br>Large office complexes can rack up enormous energy bills, but smart sensors are helping change that with smart workplace technology. These sensors adjust lighting, heating and cooling based on occupancy. If a meeting room isn't being used, the lights automatically turn off and the temperature is regulated to save energy.As a premise owner, this isnt just about cutting costs—it’s about sustainability. Many companies are prioritizing eco-friendly spaces when choosing where to set up shop. Smart sensors make your property more enticing to these tenants and can also slash your operational costs.<br>What if all employees in your building were outfitted with wearables that would track health metrics like heart rate, stress and fatigue levels? These gadgets canping them when it's time for a break or a hydration.As a premise owner, you can partner with tenants to integrate wearable tech into their health and wellness programs. This not only shows that your property supports modern, forward-thinking companies but also promotes a healthier, happier workforce. Healthier employees are more productive—and that benefits everyone.
